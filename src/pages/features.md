      We know Zoom inside-out, having used it for hundreds of online meetings,
      workshops and courses since adopting this solution in 2013. We work with
      individuals and organizations to help them enhance their communications
      using Zoom.


      **Security Analysis**


      You may have heard about the recent trend of “Zoombombing” by unwelcome visitors and hackers. We review your options and settings to protect your meeting flow, content, invited guests, and most importantly, your reputation.


      **Meeting planning**


      Having a solid plan will set up your event for success.We consult with you one-on-one to understand your meeting purpose and intended takeaways to build an appropriate meeting flow. Our experienced staff can assist with content and flow.


      **Live event support**


      During your event, your Zoom consultant will provide real-time technical support for presenters and panelists, as well as other participants.


      **Virtual Meeting Rehearsal**


      Prior to your event, we’ll schedule a virtual walk-through to test technology, transitions, and address questions to ensure the whole team feels prepared.


      **Pre-event “Green Room”**


      As your event begins, your Zoom Squad host will ensure all presenters are logged in, welcomed, audio levels are checked, flow is set, and everyone is ready for a great meeting.


      **Full Event Moderation: Q&A, transitions, content sharing**


      We just need a script. Our professionals can emcee, moderate Q&A, run the meeting/event: present slides, manage transitions, etc.Our goal is to make you look good.
