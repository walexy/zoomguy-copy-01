      - question: Why should we consider using virtual elements, even if we're planning
          an in-person, live elements?
        answer: >-
          Do you rely on "in-person" events to sustain membership, meet budget,
          or keep your champions connected to your mission?  If so, you need a
          Plan B. 


          The planning and promotion of your live event could quickly come to a screeching halt, as we've seen in a very abrupt and public way.  Incorporating virtual elements (keynote, auction, interactive elements, etc.) safeguard your budget, reputation, and in some cases, the future or your organization.
      - question: What if something goes wrong during my virtual event?
        answer: We've all seen things go wrong - power goes out, video doesn't load,
          choppy microphone, to name a few.  We focus on contingency solutions
          up front — a full run-through rehearsal before the event, back
          channels to communicate behind the scenes, live technician support,
          pre-recorded audio and video options, and more.
      - question: What are some best practices for presenters at virtual events?
        answer: >-
          Be prepared.  A presenter’s effectiveness can make or break the
          attendee experience, and train them on how the platform works and what
          to expect during the live event.


          We advise all presenters on wardrobe, stage mannerisms, creative ways to connect with the audience, and other tips we've learned through other events we've hosted.
