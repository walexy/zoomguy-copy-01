**1. Start early and start interacting**

Tired of your attendees joining you late? Set a new precedent with your audience! **Always** have your session open at least 15 minutes early to get yourself and your team prepared.Additionally, try adding some interaction motivate them to join early. Turn on your audio and video, pose fun questions, or request that they ask questions. Word will quickly spread that there is valuable time being shared before the event even starts.

**2. Bring a buddy to help you**

Have you ever hosted a large number of attendees on your own? It can be overwhelming. If you expect more than 20 people, consider bringing a subject matter expert to assist you. Zoom allows you to make them a co-host (click “more” menu next to their name in the participants list to “make co-host”) to help manage participants, chat, and Q&A. They cannot launch polls or end the meeting, however. [View this article on the ZOOM support site](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206330935-How-Do-I-Use-Co-Host-) to learn more.

**3. Use dual monitors**

It may prove quite difficult to manage all aspects of an online event on a single monitor. Add screen sharing to that and you may find windows are always in your way while you present. With a second monitor, you can host the screen sharing on your primary display and move windows like your participants list, chat, Q&A, and polling to a secondary monitor which will give you a greater ability to track everything at a glance. Don’t have dual monitors? Bring a second laptop, make sure it is made a co-host and you can monitor additional features there.

**4. Provide housekeeping**

If you want your session to be engaging and interactive, you have to use the tools to your advantage. Provide a brief housekeeping at the start of your event to show your attendees what tools you will use and set expectations. We even have some slides already prepared, just for you! Please [view this article on the Zoom support site](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/209743263-Meeting-and-Webinar-Best-Practices-and-Resources) to download housekeeping templates for hosting a Meeting or a Webinar.

**5. Waste no time getting into your content**

Many online events are service-oriented. There should be a call-to-action and there should be some form of promotion of services in your event. Consider saving that content for the end of your event. Providing a lengthy pitch at the beginning of your event encourages a lack of engagement and simply begs your attendees to tune out. Provide a brief, five-minute introduction to your event and dive right into the content. Content is what they are there to hear. If your content is compelling, they will stay with you to hear that call-to-action at the end.
