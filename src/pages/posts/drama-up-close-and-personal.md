  I am so thankful I was teaching acting this semester. It has been pure magic!
  I would do it again in a heart beat.


  They talk about HBs use of turning mics and cameras on and off. We came to the same practice. Because one student’s performance was so riveting everyone started turning their cameras off so we could see more of them. It was a dramatic moment In it’s own right. It was a show of respect for what was being given. It was powerful.


  The intimacy of the format is surprising—we have a tendency of thinking of these tools as being alienating because they lack what we view as “true” human presence. But I am getting a closer view of my students than I ever have before. I can see their breathing up close. Their facial muscles. The placement of their tongue. I see their homes. Their childhood bedrooms. The inside of their cars. Their backyards. Their kitchens. Their pets. Their families. They come early to the Zoom rooms and they stay late. And they have been giving their all. Not in spite of the Pandemic. But because of it.
