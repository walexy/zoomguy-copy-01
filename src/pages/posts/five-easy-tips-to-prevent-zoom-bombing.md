1. **Don’t use your personal meeting ID**\
   When you create a meeting, you have two options.You may use your personal ID or have a random meeting ID generated.ALWAYS generate a random meeting ID.Every Zoom user has a unique personal ID (like an email address, phone number, social security number, etc.), and once it leaks to hackers, it’s compromised forever.

2. **Enable meeting passwords**
To ensure greater security, require a password to join your meetings. If you’ve already scheduled a meeting without a password, no problem. You can always add a password without having to create a totally new Meeting ID to send to your participants. Just send it to your invitees in a separate email.

3. **Use the waiting room**
   Waiting rooms are great for smaller meetings where the invitation list is more or less set.Meeting participants will be held in a waiting room until you admit them.If you don’t recognize someone, don’t let them into the meeting.
4. **Mute audio and disable video for meeting attendees**
   Keeping video disabled and attendees muted will safeguard you against inappropriate content or comments being shared (though the chat feature might still be used.Additionally, you may remove a participant by clicking on the “Security” button and “Remove Participant.”

   If anyone other than the host wishes to speak, request that the attendee use the chat feature to request speaking time, and then mute the person once they're finished.

5. **Turn off screen sharing for everyone but the meeting host/co host**\
   Zoom bombers often use the screen sharing feature to hijack a meeting.You can confirm this setting as you set up your meeting or adjust while the meeting is happening. During a meeting, click on the arrow next to the “Screen Share” button in the menu bar. Open video options and choose “Advanced Sharing Options.”  Make sure the “Who Can Share” is set to Only Host.
